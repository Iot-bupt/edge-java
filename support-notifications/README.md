Alerts & Notifications Service - When human or other system needs to be informed of something discovered on the node by another micro service on the node, the Alerts & Notifications provides the facilities to deliver that information.  Examples of Alerts & Notifications that other services might need to broadcast include sensor data detected outside of certain parameters (as usually detected by a Rules Engine service) or system/service malfunctions (as usually detected by system management services).
